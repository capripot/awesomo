## PHP

[**Laravel**](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) is a framework that I like to refer as the Rails of PHP world.
It has a very efficient and concise API. It covers a lot of domains: ORM named Eloquent, security, template with Blade,
Browser testing named Dusk, etc. All covered with very good documentation.
